# Fermilab Internship

A combination of Python and ROOT scripts I've written.


Frameworks for analayzing different neutrino interaction models utilizing SBND-PRISM.


IMPORTANT: The Python script for the analysis and plots needs heavy optimization as much of the work is straight brute force. There is work that needs to be done to improve the structure and will allow for cleaner analysis in the future. I unfortunately did not have the time nor sufficient knowledge to improve upon it during this time.
